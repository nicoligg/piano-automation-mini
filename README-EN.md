The project is a virtual piano developed by the automation team during an internship at Mosaic Fertilizers in Brazil. It offers a fun, interactive way to play sounds using your computer keyboard. This piano is a simple yet effective implementation of a virtual piano that allows users to play various sounds.

*Functionalities:*
AutoPiano has the following features:

1. *Interactive Musical Keys:* The virtual piano features a series of musical keys, each representing a sound. Users can click keys with the mouse or use the computer keyboard to play musical notes.

2. *Visual Effects:* The piano keys have visual effects, including an animation when they are clicked or pressed on the keyboard. The keys also change color when the mouse cursor passes over them.

3. *Sound Reproduction:* Each piano key is associated with a corresponding sound. When a key is pressed, the project plays the sound that was assigned to the key.

*How users can use it:*
Users can use the piano as follows:

1. *Play with the Mouse:* To play the sound, simply click the mouse on the corresponding key on the virtual piano. The keys will respond with visual effects and sounds.

2. *Play with the Keyboard:* Users can also play the piano using the computer keyboard. Each keyboard key is mapped to a specific sound. For example, the "A" key corresponds to the cartoon jump sound. This allows users to play the piano using the keyboard.

3. *Try Different Melodies:* Users can try out different sounds using the virtual piano.
